# Weather App
A simple weather app that includes a Reactjs frontend, Nginx apigateway and Nodejs backend.


## Lessons Learned

With the help of this project, I have learnt:
- How do Dockers work? 
- Dockerizing a backend application
- Caching mechanism with Redis
- API Gateway consept
- Configuring an API Gateway with Nginx

I have faced with problems while deploying frontend and backend to the public usage. I had to solve the CORS Policy issue while sending POST requests to my backend. So, I did research on this subject, how does the CORS Policy works. Finally, I solved the problem with proper adjusments.
