# Weather App
A simple weather app that includes a Reactjs frontend, Nginx API gateway and Nodejs backend.


## Lessons Learned

With the help of this project, I have learned:
- How do Dockers work? 
- Dockerizing a backend application
- Docker compose method and docker networks
- Caching mechanism with Redis
- API Gateway concept
- Configuring an API Gateway with Nginx

I have faced problems while deploying frontend and backend to public usage. I had to solve the CORS Policy issue while sending POST requests to my backend. So, I researched how the CORS Policy works. Finally, I solved the problem with proper adjustments.
